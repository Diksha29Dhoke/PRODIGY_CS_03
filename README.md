PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER
Password complexity, also known as password strength can be defined as a measurement primarily concerned with the difficulty an attacker would encounter in trying to guess a user's password. This complexity remains significant especially when an antivirus program identifies a threat, and the strength of the user's password assists in thwarting the likelihood of the threat compromising user data.

Password complexity revolves around several elements. Mostly, it stipulates the integration of various characters, including letters (lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and symbols. What also factors into the complexity requirement is the password length, which should typically be eight or more characters. 
The Password Strength Checker is a Python script designed to assess the security level of passwords.
It evaluates passwords on factors like length, character types, and complexity to determine their strength. - Users receive detailed feedback on how to improve the strength of their passwords.

ðŸ”‘Key Features:
1. Checks password length and complexity.
2. Verifies the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
3.Provides personalized feedback to users based on the strength of their passwords.

ðŸŽ“Knowledge Gained:
âœ…Python Programming: Developed proficiency in Python programming by implementing password strength assessment algorithms.
âœ…Regular Expressions: Learned how to use regular expressions to efficiently detect special characters in passwords.
âœ…Task Documentation: Created a comprehensive README.md file to document the project features, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines.
